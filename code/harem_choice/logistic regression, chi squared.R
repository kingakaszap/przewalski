# does a logistic regression model need one of the explanatory 
# variables to be continuous?

# can i just have foal/not foal
# if not, can include age as well in the model.

# response variable: only 0/1
# r treats such data as if each row came from a binomial trial
# with sample size 1. 
# If you have unique values of one or more explanatory variables 
# for each and every individual case, 
# then a model with a binary response variable will work. 
# If not, you should aggregate the data 
# until you do have such explanatory variables
# (e.g., at the level of the household, town, state, population, â€¦).

# incidence: bird present or not
# area: size of island
# distance: dist from the mainland

# the coefficient estimates give the change in log odds (logit)

# continuous predictors: coefficients give the change
# in the log odds of the outcome for a 1 unit increase in
# the predictor variable. 
# categorical predictors: coef. estimate describes the change in the 
# log odds for each level,
# compared to the base level. 

confint(mod2)

# converting the logits to either odds ratios
# or predicted probabilities

# odds ratios
# a relative measure of effect, allowing comparisons of 2 groups
# for categorical predictors:
# >1 : a positive diff. between levels and the base level
# < 1 : negative difference
# continuous predictors: odds ratio is the odds of x+1 over x
# the odds ratio for a unit increase in the predictor
